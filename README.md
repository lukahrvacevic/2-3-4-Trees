# 2-3-4 Trees

A C++ implementation of **2-3-4 trees** and their equivalent representation as **red-black trees**, done for the university Algorithms
and Data structures course. In this case, they are being used for storing pairs of actions and their priorities. Possible options are:

1. Insert an action
2. Search the tree by priority
3. Delete action by name and priority
4. Delete max priority action
5. Formatted print of the 2-3-4 tree
6. Formatted print of the equivalent red-black tree
7. Change an action priority
8. Count of actions with given priority
9. Form the tree with input from a file
10. Delete the tree

The code can be changed so that the tree stores some other information, by changing the **rootInfo** struct, and implementing *equalKeys* and *compare* functions
for the new structure.
